My projects on GitHub are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).  
I recommend using the [CRUSTDE - Containerized Rust Development Environment](https://github.com/CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv/crustde_cnt_img_pod) to write Rust projects on Linux, isolated from your system.  

## Motivation

To access docker-hub you need a username+password or an access secret_token.  
IMPORTANT: Treat access secret_tokens like your password and keep them secret. Store your secret_tokens securely in a credential manager for example.  
Access secret_tokens are impossible to remember for an average human. We need to store them somewhere.  
FYI: Podman is an alternative "drop-in replacement" for Docker.  
I am sure they both store the docker-hub secret_token for login with the command:

```bash
podman login --username user_name docker.io
docker login --username user_name docker.io
```

WARNING: Be aware that they store the secret_token in "plain-text" in the file: `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`.  
Ok, it is not really plain-text, but base64 encoding is not a security feature.  
This means that every attacker that can get to this well-known file, can log in to our Docker Hub account. No bueno!!!

I want to secure this secret_token with encryption with an SSH key.  
We have already a lot of experience creating, managing and securing our SSH keys. The private key is secured by a passphrase we can remember and type. Every use of the secret_token will need user interaction to type the passphrase. Very secure.  

If we are very self-confident in our current session, we can store the SSH key in ssh-agent and write our passphrase only once.  
WARNING: a dedicated attacker could read from ssh-agent and discover the access secret_token without our user interaction. Use this at your discretion.  

## Replacement command

Put the executable `ssh_auth_podman_push` into the folder you intend to use it.  
After copying, make it executable with `chmod +x ssh_auth_podman_push`.  
Instead of `podman push...` use `ssh_auth_podman_push`.  
If it finds the encrypted secret_token it will ask you for the passphrase to the private SSH key.  
Else it will ask you to store the encrypted secret_token with the SSH prvate key. It will be secured behind a passphrase as SSH keys do.

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
